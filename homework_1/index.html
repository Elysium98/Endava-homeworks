        <h2>Main character</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf
          active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer,
          considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship,
          and became Ciri's adoptive father.<br />
          Geralt was born as the son of the sorceress Visenna and presumably,
          the warrior Korin. Shortly after his birth, his mother left him with
          the School of the Wolf at the stronghold of Kaer Morhen. There, Geralt
          was made and trained to become a Witcher.<br /><br />
          As a child, he was subjected to the Trial of The Grasses, he managed
          to survive the many blistering mutations required to grant Witcher's
          their abilities. After displaying unusual tolerance, Geralt was
          selected to further experimental mutations which granted him
          considerably greater strength, speed, endurance, resilience, healing,
          senses, complete immunity to diseases and conventional poisons, and
          extreme resistance to pain. This resulted in his hair turning white
          and received the nickname 'White Wolf'.
